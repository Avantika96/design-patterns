// The command pattern is one that encapsulates actions or operations as objects. So in other words, in this pattern you
// abstract the actual function or execution of the action from the action itself.And if this sounds a bit weird, it is best
// represented through code.But if you have been using Redux for any amount of time you've used the command pattern. Which is
// where we use it by extracting the actions, which are called from the execution of the actions, which are reducers.
