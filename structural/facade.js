// - [Instructor] What is a facade? It is basically the pattern of hiding complexity away by creating a facade for the
// complex code.So if you are thinking, wait, what ? That's absolutely normal. If you're a React developer, or
// building components, you've been using facades every day. When you're building your component in any framework,
// you code the complexity of this component into a module, or file, and then leverage a simple line to render this
// component into your code.Well, this is what the facade pattern is.
